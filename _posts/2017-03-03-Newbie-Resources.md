Newbies are a big challenge for us mentors. They're *almost* ready for
navigating the OS, firing-up code editors, and working with the command
line. To get them ready, we carefully select activities from a variety
of resources that build the skills they need. More, we try to keep it
fun and switch between them during class to keep the kids engaged.

When the kids start racing through these activities and get *bored*,
they're ready to advance and join the Hackers!
