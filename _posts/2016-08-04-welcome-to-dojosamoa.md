Welcome to dojosamoa – a [CoderDojo][1] here in Samoa sponsored by [Digicel][2]. Digicel provides the venue, equipment, and connectivity. Parents and volunteers run the dojo.

> "CoderDojo provides a free, safe and fun environment for
> children … to learn to code." CoderDojo Foundation.

dojosamoa sessions are held on Saturdays in the Digicel boardroom, top floor, SNPF Plaza, Savalalo. The dojo is split into two groups:

- 10 am – 11 am, Newbies, Ages 5 to 7
- 11 am – 12 pm, Hackers, Ages 7 to 12

The dojo aligns with local school terms and status updates are posted on Twitter:

The size of dojosamoa is limited. In time, we hope to accommodate more kids and add a Ninjas group for ages 12 – 17.

Enjoy!
