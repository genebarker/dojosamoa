## Hi Dojo Parent!

It's that time of year again when children are looking forward to go on school break and I got to say it has been a wonderful and fun year working with the kids as well as Eugene throughout the Digicel CoderDojo program. They have all worked so well and all deserve the best rewards.

This **Saturday 19th Nov**, we will be having a special FUN DAY at **Sogi Recreational Park** and we are requesting for you and your children to come by and celebrate your child’s hard work and effort throughout the year and have them receive their CoderDojo certificates and prizes. We also want to celebrate the graduation of some of our students who have completed 1 year of the Dojo program! Congratulations to them!

We request that you and your child in the Newbies and Hackers class be at Sogi BEFORE 10am please as the prize giving will begin at 10am sharp. (location wouldn’t be hard to miss as there will be red Digicel banners everywhere :-)

Please do not hesitate to email me if you have any questions or concerns :-)

Also let me know if your child WILL or WILL NOT be taking part this Saturday please so we can be aware :-)

Thank you for all your support and for taking interest in the CoderDojo program! :-) looking forward for another year next year!

Many thanks!
