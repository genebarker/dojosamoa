## Newbies

For this Saturday's dojo, we work further on our computational thinking. And we'll do so by playing with bees!

[Bee Sequence][1] - Code.org, Course 1, Stage 7

Help the bees find flowers, get nectar, go to the honeycomb, and make honey. See if you can finish each step with a *green* dot - given for successful completion.

As before, our mentors will throw names into a hat, and pair-up the students. One student drives and one navigates. After each step, the students switch roles and work through the same step with a different Chrome user. Then switch roles again and move on to the next step.

## Hackers

Uh oh, we're getting serious now... Databases! Our phone records, our bank records, our airline reservations, our passport records, and more, most are stored electronically in [databases][2]. This Saturday, 20 Aug 2016, we start a new set of Sushi cards, [Beginner Databases][3]. These cards introduce us to the World's most popular client-server database, [MySQL][7].

Please be patient with your mentors. We too will be learning new things along with you!

### Instructions

1. Get a copy of the Beginner Databases [Sushi Cards][6] from your mentor.
1. Get a copy of the [XAMPP installer][4] from your mentor.
2. Download a copy of the Beginner Databases [source files][5].
3. Extract the files into a folder on the desktop.
