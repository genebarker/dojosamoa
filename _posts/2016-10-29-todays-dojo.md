## Newbies

Today, we do loops!

[Maze Loops][1] - Code.org, Course 2, Stage 6

Help the angry birds get the pigs and the zombies get their sunflowers!

As before, our mentors will throw names into a hat, and pair-up the students. One student drives and one navigates. After each step, the students switch roles and work through the next step.

## Hackers

Today, there are two activities.

### Finish MySQL

A few of our Hackers are not quite done yet with this module. Today, they'll spend the first half of the dojo doing Card 8 of the [MySQL][2] database Sushi cards, [Beginner Databases][3].

### Play with Python

It's time to do some programming! Follow the below instructions to install the latest version of the powerful programming language [Python][4].

1. Open Chrome, then type `www.python.org` into the address bar.
2. Select `Downloads` drop down button, and select `Windows`.
3. Select `Latest Python 3 Release` link to download Python!
4. Open the downloaded file, and install Python using all the default options.
5. Then go to Windows start button, and select `Python 3.5` then `IDLE` to launch the Python shell.
6. Go back to Chrome, then type `docs.python.org/3/tutorial`.
7. Scroll down and select '3. An informal introduction to Python'
8. Work through the examples and see how far you can get!

### Pair Programming

If you have a partner, switch seats after your partner finishes an example block. The partner then completes the next example block. Keep going until you finish.
