## Newbies

Today, we revisit the loops stage.

[Maze Loops][1] - Code.org, Course 2, Stage 6

The kids were just starting to grasp the concept last week. Let's see how quickly they do so this week!

## Hackers

Wow, many of our Hackers enjoyed their dive into [Python][2] last week. This week, the rest of the Hackers join us. We'll be working on two modules:

### Informal Introduction to Python

Finish *3. An Informal Introduction to Python* tutorial using the `IDLE` Python shell. The module can be found here:

`https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial`

### More Control Flow Tools

Time allowing, start *4. More Control Flow Tools*.

### Pair Programming

If you have a partner, switch seats after your partner finishes an example block. The partner then completes the next example block. Keep going until you finish.
